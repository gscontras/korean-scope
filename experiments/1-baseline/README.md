# Experigen

A framework for creating phonology experiments.

## Who is it for? How can I get help?

Experigen is for linguists who have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript,  who know some of the basics of putting a webpage up, and who know a little bit of R  â€“ or for linguists who want to learn these things, or for linguists who have someone like this on their team. It's not for linguists who are ''not good with computers''.

The code is provided as is. Turn to your local web expert for help with setting up your experiment. 

If you fixed anything or added functionality to Experigen, we invite you contribute your code back to the project.

## Known limitations

Experigen does not measure reaction times.

Experigen requires participants to be online and using an active internet connection. There is no offline mode at the moment. 


## Setup

Copy the `web` folder to your server. 

Inside the `web` folder:

* Put your materials in the `resources` folder
  - Make a tab-delimited file called `items.txt`, where each line specifies
    one item (stimulus or filler). You will probably make this file in a
    spreadsheet program (Excel or some such) and save it as a text file. The
    first column in this file is special:  it uniquely identifies your items.
    It may not contain blank cells or repeated entries.
  - If your experiment contains stuff that will get randomly paired with
    your items, such as frame sentences or pictures, make tab-delimited text
    files for those, again with the first column uniquely identifying the frames
    or pictures.
  - Put audio files in mp3 format in the sounds folder, and pictures in
    the pictures folder.

* Design your experiment in the `setup` folder

  - Use `design.js` to specify the information that the participants will see
    in each screen. 
  - Use `settings.js` to specify the experiment name and the database
    server. We will maintain the database server http://db.phonologist.org/ for the foreseeable
    future. 
  - Change `styles.css` if you want to change colors, font sizes, alignments,
    and the such.

* Customize the display of the information in the `views` folder

  - Use the templates in this folder to control how the participants
    see individual screens.

* The `_lib` folder contains helper files; you don't need to go there. 

* You don't need to edit `index.html`.


## Results

Your results will accumulate on the database server you specified. 

Currently, there is only one database server available at http://db.phonologist.org/. You are welcome to use it if you want to, so long as you don't hold us responsible for anything that might happen to your data. We offer this service for free and as is. 

* To download the results, use the `getresults.R` file (you'll want to install R if you don't have it already). 

* In the `getresults.R` file, specify where your experiment is hosted (line 2). For example, if your experiment is at
    http://www.awesomeuniversity.edu/~iamawesome/questionnaire/,
    you will write www.awesomeuniversity.edu.iamawesome.questionnaire (turning slashes into periods, etc.) 

* Specify your experimentName (line 4). That's the string you entered in your `settings.js`.
  
* Run the `getresults.R` file, which will download the data and save it to your computer. 

* The default names for the created files are `exp.csv` and `meta.csv`. You can open them in Excel or OpenOffice if you want to.
